# BlenderVHS
A simple blender vhs node project using blender compositor.
<br>
If you want to use the vhs_nodes_overlay.blend file you need to download the overlay video separately
which can be download from http://www.anfx.co/motion-graphics/blank-vhs-tape-play-overlay/ <br>
You can also use your own overlay video file.
